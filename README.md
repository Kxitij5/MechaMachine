# MechaMachine
## A real-time face tracking turret inspired by KillJoy a character in the video game called Valorant.

A face tracking turret which tracks the faces of the people and aims for headshot. There are 2 versions of the project, ine which uses open-cv and a python package built upon it, known as cvzone; the other one is a custom trained YOLOv5 model which differentiates between friend and enemy before shooting.
